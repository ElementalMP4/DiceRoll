# DiceRoll
A super simple console game

# How to play

To play the game, all you do is hit enter and let the rounds run. 
The game rolls two 6 sided dice. If the sides are the same, you lose. If they are different, they are added to your score.
Every 50 points you gain an extra life which can be used to prevent you from losing.
